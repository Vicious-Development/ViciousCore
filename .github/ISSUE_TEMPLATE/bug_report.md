**Describe the bug**
What is the problem? Try to describe this in a way that makes sense.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the bug:

**Logs/Crash reports**
In almost EVERY bug, there is generally logged information. If your game crashed (even if VanillaFix is installed), you will always be able to find the crashreport in <gamefolder>/crash-reports
If no crash occurred, please provide the log of your game session <gamefolder>/logs

If you cannot follow these very simple instructions we can't help you.

**Screenshots**
If the bug has visible effects, screenshot them. Don't screenshot crash screens though.

**Installed mods**
Please provide your Modloader (currently only Forge is supported) and ViciousCore version (usually MCVER-X.Y.Z).
Optionally, it'd be appreciated if you listed installed mods, and if you expect a mod to be the source of the problem, put that one in bold.

**Anything else?**
Any additional things we should know.
