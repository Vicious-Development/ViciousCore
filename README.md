# ViciousCore
Vicious Core is a powerful mod designed to eliminate the tediousness of many processes in modding Minecraft while keeping everything as server efficient as possible. 
This includes: item and entity rendering and animation, mob spawn detection and handling.
Soon to come:
Structure generation and modification.
Tile Entities and Multiblocks.

For rendering and animation, see [ViciousCoreClient](https://github.com/Vicious-MCModding/ViciousCoreClient). which is dependent on CodeChickenLib for more information.
